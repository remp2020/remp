## [Unreleased]

### [Beam]

- Added early-version support for search in the top searchbox. Searchable are articles, authors, sections, tags and segments. GH-62
- Added support for timezone parameter in Journal aggregations. remp/remp#605
- Quick range day filters now start from beginning of the day. remp/remp#605
- Added `FORCE_HTTPS` environment variable to enforce HTTPS generation to URLs instead of determining protocol based on the request. This is useful in case you're running your application on `https`, but internally use proxy forwarding the request via `http`. remp/remp#619

### [Campaign]

- Improved intervals in campaign stats charts. remp/remp#605
- Quick range day filters now start from beginning of the day. remp/remp#605
- Added `FORCE_HTTPS` environment variable to enforce HTTPS generation to URLs instead of determining protocol based on the request. This is useful in case you're running your application on `https`, but internally use proxy forwarding the request via `http`. remp/remp#619

### [Sso]
- Added `FORCE_HTTPS` environment variable to enforce HTTPS generation to URLs instead of determining protocol based on the request. This is useful in case you're running your application on `https`, but internally use proxy forwarding the request via `http`. remp/remp#619

## [0.10.0] - 2020-04-07

- Datatables in all projects now store filters/ordering in URL hash, not in local storage. Previous solution was buggy and didn't allow users to share their filters with other users. GH-56
- Javascript building now supports linking of shared `remp` package within the projects. You can now link the package with `yarn link --cwd ../Package/remp && yarn link remp` inside the app folder. Command `yarn watch` is able to watch for changes in the shared package. GH-63

### [Beam]

- Added support for conversion rate sorting in Conversions data table. remp/remp#306
- Fixed error thrown when using main search on authors listing. remp/remp#531
- Added command to maintain data retention for rolled-over Elastic indices. remp/remp#527
- Pageviews graph in article details page loads data from Journal snapshots instead of directly quering Journal API by default. Option `PAGEVIEWS_DATA_SOURCE` added to `.env` file to allow switching to old behaviour. remp/remp#442
- `rempConfig.tracker` configuration option `explicit_referer_medium` is deprecated and renamed to `refererMedium`. The old one is still accepted due to compatibility reasons.
- Added support for referer medium renaming - one can specify label for each medium by adding a record to `referer_medium_labels` table. remp/remp#543
- Updated layout footer with link to REMP website. remp/remp#522 HEAD
- Added ability to display external events in article detail and dashboard. remp/remp#574
- Added (optional) `article_id` field to event parameters pushed to tracker. remp/remp#556
- Fixed property naming validator issue checking unique constraint against account names, not property names.
- Added article conversion/pageviews stats filtering based on selected property. GH-50
- Added support for article tags (storing tags associated with articles, filtering in data tables). remp/remp#217
- Added top articles endpoint for listing top articles by time, sections. remp/web#1010
- Fixed duplicate conversions if multiple sections/tags/authors were linked to article.
- Fixed missing conversions if no section/tag/author was linked to article. remp/remp#586
- Added articles upsert v2 api endpoint because of added `external_id` to `tags`, `authors` and `sections` tables. remp/remp#599

### [Campaign]

- Updated layout footer with link to REMP website. remp/remp#522
- Fixed missing validation rules for collapsible bar banner template. remp/remp#558
- Added support for campaign segment exclusion. User now need to match both inclusion and exclusion segment rules to see the campaign banner. GH-33
- Overal rectangle banner button text and main text attributes are now optional. This is useful when e.g. only using picture inside the banner. remp/remp#582
- Texts in collapsible bar, bar and medium rectangle bar templates are now optional. remp/remp#597

### [Mailer]

- **BREAKING**: Attachment parameter in `send-email` API is now required to be base64-encoded to support PDF (and other binary) attachments.
- **BREAKING**: Context checking during email sending now only checks if user received an email with given context before; Mailer ignores `mail_template_code` being sent. In previous version, two different mail templates with same context could be sent to the same user. This version prevents such behavior. remp/crm#987
- **BREAKING**: Removed hardcoded support for Errbit/Airbrake error logging, added support for Sentry logging. See README for details on how to configure Sentry to track errors.
- Updated layout footer with link to REMP website. remp/remp#522
- Added possibility to filter hermes payload parameters in logs. Parameters `password` and `token` are already filtered by default. See `config.neon` for reference how to extend filtering with own parameters.
- Added hermes handler to unsubscribe users from mail type if emails are dropped. You can enable the feature in `config.local.neon` (see example file for reference). remp/remp#566
- Added configuration for allowed preflight (`OPTIONS`) headers into configuration. You can configure them via `%preflight.headers` parameter - see [example use](Mailer/app/config/config.neon).
- Fixed possible duplicate email for same context being sent, in case the emails were scheduled at the same time via `send-email` API.
- Fixed and redesigned mailing list variants statistics to be sortable and filterable. remp/remp#593
- Fixed attachment_size column type - changing to integer (from incorrectly assigned datetime).
- Added option to select events to handle when starting Hermes worker in case there's need to run separate workers for mission-critical event types.
- Fixed possibly incorrectly skipped newsletter subscription in user registered API handler. remp/crm#1159

### [Beam]

- (GO) Removed unused vendor files.

### [Campaign]

- Tables `campaign_banners` and `campaign_country` didn't have primary keys since creation. This was preventing migrations on the replicated instances. This release fixes the failing migration issue. https://github.com/remp2020/remp/commit/f211d2c5d40fa3cb5a232396210543e397c6c439

  ```


## [0.8.1] - 2019-07-10

> **Elasticsearch upgrade notice**. We'll be raising Elasticsearch compatibility to 7.* in the beginning of 2020 to keep with the latest changes. Current implementation Segments API is tested and maintained again Elasticsearch 6.*. Please plan your upgrade accordingly.


### [Beam]

- Added experimental database-based dashboard data source which works with snapshot of "concurrents" data made every minute. Snapshotting is being done automatically for you against *concurrents_by_browser* elastic index. This should be populated by your Telegraf instance based on [similar configuration](https://github.com/remp2020/remp/blob/master/Docker/telegraf/telegraf.conf#L73).

- [Segments]: Fixing mapping fetching changes which was causing "include_type_name" deprecation notices since Elastic 6.8. This is to prepare to provide full compatibility for Elastic 7.* and drop compatibility promise for 6.* in the following months.


## [0.8.0] - 2019-07-08

_Note: Generated binaries were not changed since 0.7.0, there's no need to redeploy them if you have 0.7.0 deployed._

### [Beam]

- New functions for tracking commerce events were added to give caller more precise control over what is being tracked.  See documentation of following methods in https://github.com/remp2020/remp/tree/master/Beam#js-tracking-interface:

  - `remplib.tracker.trackCheckoutWithSource`
  - `remplib.tracker.trackPaymentWithSource`
  - `remplib.tracker.trackPurchaseWithSource`
  - `remplib.tracker.trackRefundWithSource`

- In some cases, Beam's database could have been migrated with invalid default value for conversion's _paid_at_ column. https://github.com/remp2020/remp/commit/553c2dcf9120b0b54e938d7e3f5f1a9dca3a73e2

### [Campaign]

- New configuration options were added to append extra query parameters to banner's target URL in case target page needs to identify source page/article and referer is not enough.

  See `rempConfig.campaign.bannerUrlParams` object at https://github.com/remp2020/remp/tree/master/Campaign#javascript-snippet for more detailed info:

  ```
  bannerUrlParams:  {
      "foo": function() { return "bar" },
      "baz": function() { return "XXX" }
  }
  ```

- HTML banner now supports custom JS and CSS inclusion from external sources.
- Bugfixing HTML banner's Farbtastic color picker which was not being initialized after the latest dependency changes.
- Material checkbox was not being rendered properly in Mailer causing custom generator implementations not being able to use it.

### [Mailer]

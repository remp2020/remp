## [3.2] - 2023-08-24

- [3.2.1] [Mailer]: Fixed Mailer segment provider users acquiring. Provided segment code needs to be processed before fetching users from database. remp/mnt#114
- [3.2.2] [Mailer]: Fixed Beam's invalid namespaces and routes.

### Project

- Removed `dockerize` from Dockerfiles across the project. It's been replaced by native Docker Compose healthcheck feature.
- Added Elasticsearch and Telegraf configs directly to their respective Docker images, so there's a default config if one is not provided via volume.
- Fixed issue with `yarn link` not being able to link JS packages due to version conflict. remp/remp#1293
- Added explicit `packageManager` definition into `package.json` files so Yarn v3 doesn't complain about outdated lockfile. remp/remp#1294

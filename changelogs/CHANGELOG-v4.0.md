## [4.0.0] - 2025-04-29

### [Beam]

- **BREAKING**: Updated Laravel to v12. remp/remp#1409
  - Please be aware that upgrade causes any assets published during Laravel's dependencies installation (`vendor:publish`) to have stricter rights by default (`0700` for directories, `0600` for files). You might need to update the rights of `public/vendor/` after the `composer install` call.
- **BREAKING**: Laravel changed its caching prefixes not to include `:` character automatically.
  - If you used `REDIS_PREFIX` env variable, we recommend to add `:` to your prefix to maintain consistency with the caching keys.
- **BREAKING**: Removed support for Airbrake/Errbit without replacement. The app still supports Sentry for error handling by default. remp/remp#1409
- **BREAKING**: Renamed Laravel's `FILESYSTEM_DRIVER` env variable to `FILESYSTEM_DISK`. remp/remp#1409
- **BREAKING**: Changed minimum Go version for building Tracker API and Segments API to 1.23.
- **BREAKING**: Removed `snowplow/referer-parser` dependency from PHP application. Beam wasn't using this anymore after removal of device stats. remp/remp#1409
- **BREAKING**: Replaced abandoned `laravelcollective/html` with `spatie/laravel-html`. remp/remp#1409
- **IMPORTANT**: Removed data of sections "Visitors" and "Google Analytics Reporting", which we removed in the previous version. remp/remp#1349
  - Migration removes tables `session_devices` and `session_referers`.
- Fixed banner preview components to include and run custom JS inside of iframe. remp/crm#3353
- Added option to specify API version for gender balance in env. remp/helpdesk#3303
- Fixed newsletter criteria not always selecting the desired number of articles. remp/respekt#378
- [Segments] Fixed missing mapping of some optional Elasticsearch fields (`subscribed`, `signed_in`, `revenue`). remp/remp#1394
  - Mapping is now pushed explicitly during Segments service startup.
  - Missed mapping may have caused problems when doing group by filter using untracked field.

### [Campaign]

- **BREAKING**: Updated Laravel to v12. remp/remp#1409
  - If you encounter issues with Showtime requests caused by `AbstractParser` of the device detector library, please purge the Redis cache with this command: `redis-cli -h REDIS-HOST -p REDIS-PORT -n REDIS-DEFAULT-DB keys 'Device*' | xargs redis-cli -h REDIS-HOST -p REDIS-PORT -n REDIS-DEFAULT-DB del`.
